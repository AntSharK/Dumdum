        <h3>OBJECTIVE</h3>
        You own a ball. Every round, your ball goes into an arena with other balls. <br />
        The objective is to be the last player in the game. <br />
        Every round, every player except the top person loses points. <br />
        Ranking is determined by your ball's total HP left. Balls eliminated early lose more points. <br />
        When you get to 0 points, you are out of the game. <br />
        <br />
        <h3>FIGHTING</h3>
        When two balls collide, each ball does damage to the other ball. <br />
        Damage dealt gives you credits. <br />
        Damage dealt can be reduced by armor and other upgrades. <br />
        <br />
        <h3>USER INTERFACE</h3>
        The cost of each upgrade is displayed on the top-right of the card. <br />
        The number of credits you have left will be displayed in the top-right. <br />
        Click on an upgrade card to buy it. Buying a card will refresh the shop. <br />
        Pressing the refresh icon will also refresh the shop. Refreshing costs 1 credit. <br />
        Clicking on your ball will alternate between showing your stats and showing notable upgrades. <br />
        <br />
        <h3>BUYING UPGRADES</h3>
        You can buy upgrades that you can't afford. The debt will be collected on the next round. <br />
        Unspent credits at the end of every round will be thrown away. <br />
        At the end of every round, you will get more credits. The amount you are given increases per round. <br />
        You start with a "Payday" upgrade which gives you credits when you do damage. <br />
        As long as you have credits, you can continue buying upgrades after the round starts. However, they won't apply until the next round. <br />
        If, on the previous round, you spent more credits than you had, they will be deducted from you on the next round. <br />
        <br />
        <h3>UPGRADING THE SHOP</h3>
        Upgrading the shop gives you better upgrades. <br />
        This adds the better upgrades into the pool - old upgrades will stil show up. <br />
        Upgrading the shop also allows you to see more upgrades per refresh. <br />
