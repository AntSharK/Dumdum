        <h3>[1] - Stats</h3>
        Points - You lose a certain number of points every round, depending on how long your ball survives. Once you get to 0 points, you lose. <br />
        HP - Every round, your ball starts with that many Hit Points. When it runs out of hit points, you lose that round. The longer your ball survives, the fewer points you lose. <br />
        DMG - Each round, when balls collide, they deal damage to each other. <br />
        Armor - When balls collide, armor reduces the damage that your ball takes. <br />
        Speed - The base speed of your ball. <br />
        Size - The base size of your ball. <br />
        <br />
        <h3>[2] - Credits Left</h3>
        The number of credits you have left. Unspent credits at the end of each round are not refunded. <br />
        At the start of each round, you gain a certain amount of credits. <br />
        You get more credits the later the game goes. <br />
        You can go into debt by purchasing upgrades. <br />
        <br />
        <h3>[3] - Improve Upgrades</h3>
        This is the cost of improving your upgrades. <br />
        Improving your upgrades will let you see better upgrades, and also lets you see more upgrades. <br />
        <br />
        <h3>[4] - See More Upgrades</h3>
        You can spend 1 credit to refresh your cards and see a new batch of upgrades. <br />
        At the start of each round, blank cards are replaced - but existing cards are not refreshed. <br />
        <br />
        <h3>[5] - Purchase an Upgrade</h3>
        You can purchase an upgrade for the cost listed in the top-right. <br />
        Purchased upgrades go into effect next round. Upgrades can be purchased when your ball is in the Arena, but will only apply next round. <br />
        <br />
        <h3>[6] - Persistent Effect Cards</h3>
        You can hold up to 6 persistent effect cards at any time. <br />
        Click on the card in your ball to view its description. <br />
        You can also sell these cards at any time at full price. <br />
        <br />
        <h3>[7] - Upgrade Duration</h3>
        Some upgrades have durations. These are persistent effects. <br />
        You can only have up to 6 persistent effect cards at any time. <br />
        Once these upgrades expire, they are automatically sold at full price. <br />
